		<description>
			<p>The five subclasses in this document are designed for characters who dedicate themselves to one of the paths of magic practiced at Strixhaven.</p>
			<p class="indent">The university of Strixhaven is home to a wide variety of students and spellcasters. While individuals are welcome to pursue their magical studies in whichever way they please, some choose to focus exclusively on the fundamentals of one of the university’s five colleges:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Lorehold College</strong>, dedicated to the pursuit of history by conversing with ancient spirits and understanding the whims of time itself</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Prismari College</strong>, dedicated to the visual and performing arts and bolstered with the power of the elements</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Quandrix College</strong>, dedicated to the study and manipulation of nature’s core mathematic principles</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Silverquill College</strong>, dedicated to the magic of words, whether encouraging speeches that uplift allies or piercing wit that derides foes</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Witherbloom College</strong>, dedicated to the alchemy of life and death and harnessing the devastating energies of both</p>

	<element name="Using These Subclasses" type="Rule" source="Unearthed Arcana: Mages of Strixhaven" id="ID_WOTC_UA20210608_RULE_USING_THESE_SUBCLASSES">
		<description>
			<p>Unlike regular subclasses, the options presented here are designed to be compatible with multiple classes. The classes that are compatible with each subclass option are specified in each subclass’s entry.</p>
			<h5>Choosing the Subclass</h5>
			<p>When you choose a subclass for your character (a bard’s Bardic College, a wizard’s Arcane Tradition, and so on), you can instead choose one of these subclass options, so long as the subclass is compatible with your character’s class. You can choose the subclass only once, even if you multiclass into another class that is also compatible with the subclass.</p>
			<p class="indent">How the subclass manifests in your character’s story is up to you. Perhaps your sorcerer’s innate spark of elemental magic has been determinedly honed by this schooling ever since they first showed arcane potential, or your warlock eschewed their patron’s usual boons for learning these more esoteric manifestations of power. Maybe your druid chose to attend university instead of joining a druidic circle, or your wizard balked at a traditional apprenticeship in favor of newfangled numeromancy.</p>
			<h5>At Higher Levels</h5>
			<p>Like regular subclasses, the subclass you choose here grants your character new abilities at higher levels. When your character would normally gain a new subclass feature (as noted in your character’s class table), you gain a feature from this subclass instead. All the subclass features detailed here have a level prerequisite, as noted beneath their name, and you must meet the prerequisite to gain the feature. For example, to gain a feature noted as “Level 6+,” your character must be 6th level or higher in the class for which the subclass was chosen. So if you’re a wizard with the Mage of Prismari subclass, you must be a 6th-level wizard to gain the Favored Medium feature.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you reach certain levels, you might be eligible to choose from among multiple features in the subclass. When you reach such a point, you select one of these features for your character to gain. Unless otherwise specified, you can gain no more than one subclass feature at a time. For example, if you are a bard with the Mage of Lorehold subclass, at 14th level you gain your choice of either the War Echoes feature or the History’s Whims feature, but not both.</p>

			<p><em>Bard, Warlock, and Wizard Subclass</em></p>
			<p>Mages of Lorehold are particularly concerned with the forces that underlie and drive history. Drawing inspiration from the scholars and adventurers of old, they manifest the arcane power of the past through ethereal dioramas and fantastical battle prowess. Lorehold mages are often found with a long-dead spirit summoned at their side—for who better to learn ancient history from than one who has experienced it first-hand?</p>
			<h5>USING THIS SUBCLASS</h5>
			<p>Upon selecting the Mage of Lorehold subclass, you gain two features: Lorehold Spells and Ancient Companion.</p>
			<p class="indent">In this subclass’s features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you’re a bard, the College of Lorehold counts as your college; if you’re a warlock, the magic of the college serves as your patron; and if you’re a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here.

			<p>You learn to call on the spirits of the ancient dead and house them temporarily in the remnants of old statues, so they may remain longer on this plane to bolster your studies and aid you in battle.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can call forth and bond with one such spirit, who comes to inhabit a Medium, freestanding statue within 10 feet of you to serve as your ancient companion. See this creature’s game statistics in the Ancient Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When you bond with your ancient companion, choose the type of spirit you bond with: Healer, Sage, or Warrior. Your choice of spirit determines certain traits in its stat block. The statue determines the spirit’s appearance.</p>
			<p class="indent">The ancient companion is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. In combat, the companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended.</p>
			<p class="indent">The companion perishes when it drops to 0 hit points, when you bond with a new ancient companion at the end of a short or long rest, or when you die. When the companion perishes, the spirit within returns to its plane of origin, and the statue becomes an inert object.</p>

			<p><strong><em>Ancient Fortitude.</em></strong> If damage reduces the companion to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, the companion drops to 1 hit point instead.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Sage’s Counsel (Sage Only).</em></strong> While within 15 feet of the companion, you and your allies gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence and Wisdom checks.</p>
			<h4 style="margin-top:10px">Actions</h4>
			<p><strong><em>Spirit Strike. </em></strong><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. Hit:1d8 + 2 + PB force damage.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Healer’s Light (Healer Only).</em></strong> The companion chooses a creature it can see within 15 feet of itself and flares with invigorating light. The creature gains 1d8 + PB temporary hit points.</p>
			<h4 style="margin-top:10px">Reactions</h4>
			<p><strong><em>Warrior’s Protection (Warrior Only). </em></strong>When a creature within 5 feet of the companion makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, the companion imposes itself between the creature and the danger. The creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw.</p>

It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. &#13;
			As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended. &#13;
			The companion perishes when it drops to 0 hit points, when you bond with a new ancient companion at the end of a short or long rest, or when you die. When the companion perishes, the spirit within returns to its plane of origin, and the statue becomes an inert object.</description>

			<p>Mages of Prismari use surges of elemental energy to express who they are and how they see the world. To them, magic and motion are one and the same;  both are exhibitions of raw creativity through which masterpieces are made. In their pursuit of the arts, some Prismari mages focus on perfecting the fine details of their technique, while others prefer to unleash their wild creative visions in dazzling spectacles of elemental power.</p>
			<h5>USING THIS SUBCLASS</h5>
			<p>Upon selecting the Mage of Prismari subclass, you gain two features: Creative Skills and Kinetic Artistry.</p>
			<p class="indent">In this subclass’s features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you’re a druid, the College of Prismari counts as your circle; if you’re a sorcerer, the magic of the college is the origin of your sorcery; and if you’re a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.</p>

			<description>When you finish a long rest, you can use an herbalism kit and a pot or cauldron to create magical brews. You create {{proficiency}} brews. Each brew requires its own flask. A brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. For each brew, choose one of the following effects:
			• Fortifying. When you create this brew, choose a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, necrotic, poison, or radiant. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient gains resistance to the chosen damage type for 1 hour.
			• Quickening. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains 2d6 hit points, and one disease or condition from the following list affecting the recipient ends (brew user’s choice): charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned.
			• Toxifying. As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a simple or martial weapon. The next time the weapon or a piece of ammunition fired by it hits a creature within 1 hour, the target takes 2d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against DC{{ua:witherbloom brew:dc}} or be poisoned for 1 minute.</description>
