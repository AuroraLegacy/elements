			<p>In today’s <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>, we explore D&amp;D character options from across the multiverse. This playtest document presents the glitchling race; the Fate Domain cleric subclass; and the gate warden, giant foundling, planar philosopher, and rune carver backgrounds. Additionally, a collection of new feats provide links to giants and other primordial forces of the planes, while a selection of new spells highlight the power of fate and chance.</p>

	<!-- Glitchling Race -->
	<element name="Glitchling" type="Race" source="Unearthed Arcana: Wonders of the Multiverse" id="ID_WOTC_UA20220718_RACE_GLITCHLING">
		<description>
			<p>Created by forces of planar law, glitchlings are winged, human-like creatures made from a merger of magic and machine. These explorers seek to learn all they can about the multiverse and its creatures. Some glitchlings then carry what they learn back to lawful planes, like Mechanus, to inform the orderly working of the multiverse. Others become enamored with travel and the peoples they encounter, and they seek to make a life of their own among the planes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Glitchlings begin their existences with rudimentary personalities. As they absorb information and experiences, their personalities grow, but many retain quirks associated with their lawful origins. You can roll or choose a quirk from the Orderly Quirk table or create your own.</p>
			<h5>Orderly Quirk</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Quirk</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>I collect things, whether a specific kind of object or things made of a particular material.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>We think of ourselves as being a part of the collective, lawful forces of the multiverse and don’t refer to ourselves as a singular being.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>I seek out new experiences so I can better understand the freedom of my existence.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>I preface things I say with a short description, such as: “observation,” “interjection,” or “query.”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>I plan elaborate responses to every contingency, ready to execute at an instant’s notice.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>I investigate people’s intentions behind their actions, trying to solve the equation that guides them.</td></tr>

			<h4>Glitchling Traits</h4>
			<p>As a glitchling, you have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Construct.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Armored Plating.</em></strong> Your metal skin is reinforced with armor plates. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 14 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Balance Chaos.</em></strong> When you make an attack roll or a saving throw and roll a 9 or lower on the d20, you can balance chaos and treat the roll as a 10. You can balance chaos in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Living Construct.</em></strong> You were created to benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don’t affect Constructs: <i>cure wounds</i>, <i>healing word</i>, <i>mass cure wounds</i>, <i>mass healing word</i>, and <i>spare the dying</i>.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ordered Mind.</em></strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks and on saving throws made to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Vestigial Wings.</em></strong> You have vestigial wings that allow limited flight. When you move, you can engage your wings to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of the current turn. If you are still aloft at the end of the turn with nothing else supporting you, you fall. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>Though you aren’t a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Something about your environment—perhaps the food or water that sustained you through childhood, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you—ensured that you grew to a remarkable size. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the titanic might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life.</p>

				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Card Focus.</strong> You can use a deck of cards as your spellcasting focus. When you use the deck as a focus to cast a spell that deals damage, roll a d4. You gain a bonus to one damage roll of the spell equal to the number rolled. This bonus applies to one creature of your choice that you can see damaged by the spell; you can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Card Tricks.</strong> You learn the <i>prestidigitation</i> cantrip and can use it to create illusions that duplicate the effects of stage magic. When you use <i>prestidigitation</i> in this way, you can conceal the verbal and somatic components of the spell as mundane conversation and card-handling.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Hidden Ace.</strong> When you finish a long rest, you can choose one spell you know and imbue it into a card; the chosen spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and its level must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. While the card is imbued with the spell, you can use your bonus action to flourish the card and cast the spell within. The card then immediately loses its magic.</li>

				<tr><td>2</td><td><b>Battle Fury.</b> A creature of your choice that you can see is filled with reckless fury. The creature has advantage on attack rolls and disadvantage on ability checks.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td><b>Unbound.</b> When you move, you can use some or all of your walking speed to teleport once, along with any equipment you’re wearing or carrying, up to the distance used to an unoccupied space that you can see.</td></tr>

			<p>You have absorbed primeval magic that gives you an echo of the might of giants. Choose one of the kinds of giants listed below. As a bonus action, you can call on the power of your giant magic to imbue your attacks with additional power. The next time you hit a target with a melee or thrown weapon attack within the next minute, the attack has an additional effect depending on the origin of your giant magic:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Hill Giant.</strong> The target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Stone Giant.</strong> The target takes an extra 1d6 force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you in a straight line.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Frost Giant.</strong> The target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Fire Giant.</strong> The target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Cloud Giant.</strong> The target takes an extra 1d4 thunder damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you become invisible to it until the start of your next turn.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"><strong>Storm Giant.</strong> The target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The saving throw DC for these effects equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Constitution modifier.</p>

			<p>You touch the ground and conjure forth a defensive structure made of enormous playing cards. The structure rises with you at its center, harmlessly lifting you and any creatures in the area. The house of cards has a square base that is 30 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. The second floor is 20 feet on each side, and the top floor is 10 feet on each side—both centered above the bottom floor. Ramps connect the interior of each floor, and empty doorframes connect the interior and exterior of each level. Creatures inside or on top of the structure have half cover.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each card that comprises the house is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall and is very fragile. A card has AC 10 and 1 hit point. The cards are immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a card to 0 hit points destroys it. Every time a card is destroyed, roll 1d6. If you roll a 5 or a 6, the house collapses, ending the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">The house and all its cards vanish when the spell ends.</p>
