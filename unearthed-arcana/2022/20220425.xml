	<!--Kender Race-->
	<element name="Kender" type="Race" source="Unearthed Arcana: Heroes of Krynn Revisited" id="ID_WOTC_UA20220425_RACE_KENDER">
		<description>
			<p>During the mythical origins of Krynn, Reorx, god of craft, indulged in an age of unfettered creation. Many peoples sprang from his divine forge, but not all among them remained as the god created them. Altered by unbridled magic, a group of gnomes were transformed and gifted almost supernatural curiosity and fearlessness. These were the first kender.</p>
			<p class="indent">Originating on the world of Krynn, kender are diminutive Humanoids that look like humans with pointed ears and diverse appearances. Kender have a supernatural curiosity that drives them to adventure. Due to this inquisitiveness, many kender find themselves falling through portals to other planes and worlds.</p>
			<p class="indent">Kender sometimes amass impressive collections of curiosities. Some might collect mundane knickknacks or relics from magical sites, while others might become professional thieves.</p>
			<h4>Kender Traits</h4>
			<p>As a kender, you have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Small.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fearless.</em></strong> You are immune to the frightened condition.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Kender Curiosity.</em></strong> Thanks to the mystical origin of your people, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Insight, Investigation, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, or Survival.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Taunt.</em></strong> You have an extraordinary ability to fluster creatures. As a bonus action, you can unleash a string of provoking words at a creature within 60 feet of you that can hear and understand you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn. The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this race).</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Divinely Favored (this document)</li>
				<li>Skilled (Player’s Handbook)</li>

			</ul>
			<h3>4th-Level Bonus Feat</h3>

			<p>You have trained to be a valorous warrior known as a Knight of Solamnia. Strict rules guide your every action, and you work to uphold them as you strive to defend the weak and oppose all forms of evil. Your honor is as important to you as your life.</p>

			<h5>BUILDING A KNIGHT OF SOLAMNIA CHARACTER</h5>
			<p>Any class or subclass that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. Fighters and paladins make up the bulk of the knighthood’s forces. Clerics (often with the War domain) can also be found among the knights' ranks.</p>
			<p class="indent">For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the College of Valor (or the College of Swords from <i>Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</i>) or a barbarian devoted to the ideals of the nature god Habbakuk (perhaps adopting the Path of the Zealot from <i>Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</i>)</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Suggested Characteristics.</em></strong> Adventurers who dedicate themselves to protecting the innocent and upholding honorable virtues are welcomed among the Knights of Solamnia. The Knight of Solamnia Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.</p>
			<h5>Knight of Solamnia Personality Traits</h5>

		<description>
			<p>Your talent for magic came to the attention of the Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters that study magic and prevent its misuse. You've trained among the Mages, but whether or not you'll face the dangerous tests required to become a true member of the group remains to be determined. Your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the organization's three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery. The organization accepts more than wizards, though, with bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters included among their ranks.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Arcana, History</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</li>

			<h5>BUILDING A MAGE OF HIGH SORCERY CHARACTER</h5>
			<p>Mages of High Sorcery are typically bards, wizards, or warlocks and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion or who possess innate magic are less likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcery are shrewd, and they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in magic might find a rare place among the group's three orders.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Suggested Characteristics.</em></strong> The study of magic drives the Mages of High Sorcery. Consider which of the group's three orders you aspire to join. The Mage of High Sorcery Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character.</p>
			<h5>Mage of High Sorcery Personality Traits</h5>

			<p><b>Note:</b> Other Feats, like <i>Knight of the Rose</i> or <i>Adept of the White Robes</i>, can't be fully unlocked with this item, because their features are based on <i>Squire of Solamnia</i> and <i>Initiate of High Sorcery</i> features. Instead, this item allows you to ignore level prerequisite for those Feats, and <i>Adept of the Black Robes</i>, <i>Adept of the Red Robes</i> and <i>Adept of the White Robes</i> no longer require specific Krynn Moon to be selected.</p>
