	<!--Kender Race-->
	<element name="Kender" type="Race" source="Unearthed Arcana: Heroes of Krynn" id="ID_WOTC_UA20220308_RACE_KENDER">
		<description>
			<p>Native to the world of Krynn, Kender are diminutive Humanoids that look like humans with pointed ears and diverse appearances. Kender have a supernatural curiosity that drives them on to adventures big and small. This curiosity is said to be connected to the whimsical magic of the Feywild, that some believe kender have a high affinity for. Due to their curiosity, many kender have found themselves falling through gates and portals to other planes and worlds.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unknown to most mortals, a magical phenomenon surrounds a kender. Spurred by their curiosity and love for trinkets, curios, and keepsakes, a kender’s pouches or pockets will be magically filled with these objects. No one knows where these objects come from, not even the kender.This has led many kender to be mislabeled as thieves when they fish these items out of their pockets.</p>
			<h4>Kender Traits</h4>
			<p>As a kender, you have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Small.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Brave.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the frightened condition on yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Kender Ace.</em></strong> Starting at 3rd level, you possess a magical ability to pull an item out of a bag or another container; as a bonus action, you can reach into a container you’re carrying and roll on the Kender Aces table to determine what item you pull out. The object glimmers softly and disappears after 1 hour. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. On Krynn, the gods of magic are associated with the world's three moons. On the world of Toril, the god Selûne uses the light of the moon to battle darkness. On Eberron, scholars of the Draconic Prophecy decipher ancient secrets from the waxing and waning of that world's twelve moons.</p>
			<p class="indent">You, or someone from your lineage, has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells. Consult the Manifestations of Lunar Magic table, then choose or randomly determine how your connection to the moon manifests while you cast your sorcerer spells.</p>
			<h5>MANIFESTATIONS OF LUNAR MAGIC</h5>

				<thead>
					<tr><td>d4</td><td>Manifestation</td></tr>

				<tr><td>1</td><td>You glow with faint light that matches the color of a moon from your world.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Your pupils shift in shape, matching the current phase of a moon from your world.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>Spectral manifestations of the moon (or moons) of your world orbit you.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>Your shadow is limned in faint light, as if it were a lunar body during a solar eclipse.</td></tr>

			<p>Your lunar phase magic bursts. As a bonus action, you can tap into a special power of the lunar phase you are currently in.

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Full Moon.</em></strong> You radiate intense moonlight for a moment. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>New Moon.</em></strong> You momentarily emanate an oppressive gloom. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d10 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Crescent Moon.</em></strong> You slip through light and darkness. You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. In addition, you also gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.</p>

			<p>You have trained to be a valorous warrior known as a Knight of Solamnia. Strict rules guide your every action, and you work to uphold them as you strive to defend the weak and oppose all forms of evil. Your honor is as important to you as your life.</p>

			<p>Any class or subclass that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. Fighters and paladins make up the bulk of the knighthood’s forces. Clerics (often with the War domain) can also be found among the knights' ranks.</p>
			<p>For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the College of Valor (or the College of Swords from <i>Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</i>) or a barbarian devoted to the ideals of the nature god Habbakuk (perhaps adopting the Path of the Zealot from <i>Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</i>)</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Suggested Characteristics.</em></strong> Adventurers who dedicate themselves to protecting the innocent and upholding honorable virtues are welcomed among the Knights of Solamnia. The Knight of Solamnia Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Your talent for magic came to the attention of the Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters that study magic and prevent its misuse. You've trained among the Mages, but whether or not you'll face the dangerous tests required to become a true member of the group remains to be determined. Your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the organization's three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery. The organization accepts more than wizards, though, with bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters included among their ranks.</p>

				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Arcana, History</li>

			<h5>BUILDING A MAGE OF HIGH SORCERY CHARACTER</h5>
			<p>Mages of High Sorcery are typically bards, wizards, or warlocks and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion or who possess innate magic are less likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcery are shrewd, and they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in magic might find a rare place among the group's three orders.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Suggested Characteristics.</em></strong> The study of magic drives the Mages of High Sorcery. Consider which of the group's three orders you aspire to join. The Mage of High Sorcery Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character.</p>
