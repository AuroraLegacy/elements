			<p class="flavor">In some campaigns, humanoids normally regarded as sinister threats can emerge to adventure alongside humans and the other standard races. This section is aimed at those who wish to expand the race selections for their campaigns beyond the typical folk of D&amp;D.</p>
			<h4>HOBGOBLIN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your hobgoblin character has the following racial traits.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Age.</span>Hobgoblins mature at the same rate as humans and have lifespans similar in length to theirs.<br/>
				<!-- (removed in Errata v3.0) -->
				<!-- <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Hobgoblin society is built on fidelity to a rigid, unforgiving code of conduct. As such, they tend toward lawful evil.<br/> -->
				<span class="feature">Size.</span>Hobgoblins are between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 30 feet. <br/>
				<span class="feature">Darkvision.</span>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Martial Training.</span>You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor.<br/>
				<span class="feature">Saving Face.</span>Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies	you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5).
