	<element name="Customized Ability Score Increases" type="Option" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_OPTION_CUSTOMIZED_ASI">
		<description>
			<p>The Ability Score Increase trait in a race reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&amp;D’s past. For example, if you’re a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&amp;D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn’t apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it’s unhelpful if your character doesn’t conform to the archetype.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you’d like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here’s how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can’t apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can’t increase a score above 20.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.</p>

	<element name="Customized Proficiencies" type="Option" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_OPTION_CUSTOMIZED_PROFICIENCY">
		<description>
			<p>Some races that include the Ability Score Increase trait also grant proficiencies. These proficiencies are usually cultural, but your character might not have any connection to the culture in question or might have pursued different training. You can replace each of those proficiencies with a different one, as shown on the Proficiency Swaps table.</p>

	<element name="Customized Language" type="Option" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_OPTION_CUSTOMIZED_LANGUAGE">
		<description>
			<p>If your character’s race has the Languages trait, that trait includes languages that your character is assumed to know, usually Common and the language of your ancestors. For example, a halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common and Halfling. Here’s the thing: D&amp;D adventurers are extraordinary, and your character might have grown up speaking languages different from the ones in your Languages trait.</p>
			<p class="indent">To customize the languages you know, you may replace each language in your Languages trait with a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon</p>
