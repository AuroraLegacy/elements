			<p>An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.</p>

			<p>You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change the armor’s model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Guardian.</em></strong> You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Thunder Gauntlets.</strong> Each of the armor’s gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren’t holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else. </p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 20px"><strong>Defensive Field.</strong> As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have.

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Infiltrator.</em></strong> You can customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Lightning Launcher.</strong> A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Thunder Gauntlets.</em></strong> Your armored fists each count as a simple melee weapon, and each deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Defensive Field.</em></strong> You gain a bonus action that you can use on each of your turns to gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Perfected Feature.</em></strong> When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled up to 30 feet toward you in an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
