			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>

			<h5>BUILDING A GATE WARDEN CHARACTER</h5>
			<p>Rewarded characters have varied histories, but they have one thing in common: they were down on their luck before their lives abruptly turned around. They might have given up all hope of a happier life, only to suddenly get a second chance. A rewarded character has often spent many years struggling to escape painful circumstances. Now, extricated from the (sometimes literal) prison that was their former life, they throw their cares to the wind and become adventurers.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your character's life was changed by a Deck of Many Things, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps the Fates card undid a tragic mistake your character made in their youth. The Gem card could have wiped out debts incurred over a lifetime. Maybe the Sage card provided the advice needed to escape a hopeless situation, the Star card increased an ability score to its current value, or a Wish spell cast after drawing the Moon card transformed your character from a peddler to a fledgling sorcerer infused with magic and new knowledge and skills. If you're making a character at higher than 1st level, magic items they have could have been granted by the Key or Sun card.</p>
			<h5>REWARDED TRINKETS</h5>
			<p>When you make your character, you can roll once on the Rewarded Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook for your starting trinket.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td class="col-10">d6</td><td>Trinket</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>A perfumed silk scarf from an admirer</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>A crystal bead that glows like a candle in the dark</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>A letter of introduction and invitation from an influential person in a far-off city</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>A motto or symbol whose meaning eludes you, etched on a piece of your equipment</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>A crisp playing card that never seems to tear or soil, depicting the card that affected you</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Half a medallion designed to be rejoined to its other half</td></tr>

			<p>Your unexpected good fortune is reflected by a minor boon. You gain the Lucky, Magic Initiate, or Skilled feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects the transformation that changed your life. An encounter with a genie who gave you three wishes might have resulted in magical powers represented by Magic Initiate. If you paid off all your family debts with a fortuitous round of three-dragon ante, you might be Lucky instead. Alternatively, you could use the Skilled feat to reflect whatever trial you endured to secure your new destiny and to model the knowledge and abilities imparted to you by whatever force transformed your life.</p>
