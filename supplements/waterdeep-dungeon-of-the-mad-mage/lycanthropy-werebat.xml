			<p>A werebat is a humanoid afflicted with a rare form of lycanthropy that enables it to transform into a giant bat or a bat-humanoid hybrid. (See the <i>Monster Manual</i> for more information on lycanthropy.) Most werebats are of goblin stock.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Deep Dwellers.</i></b> Werebats are shunned even by goblin society because of their need to feed on blood to survive. They prefer to lair in dark places, such as attics and caves, and typically adopt nocturnal hunting habits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Blood Drinkers.</i></b> A werebat must consume at least 1 pint of fresh blood each night, or it weakens and gains one level of exhaustion that no amount of rest alone can remove. Each pint of blood the werebat consumes removes one level of exhaustion gained in this fashion.</p>
			<h4>WEREBAT LYCANTHROPY</h4>
			<p>The lycanthropes entry in the <i>Monster Manual</i> has rules for characters afflicted with different forms of lycanthropy. A player character who becomes a werebat gains the following traits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Dexterity.</i></b> A character cursed with werebat lycanthropy gains a Dexterity of 17 if their score isn't already higher.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Speed (Bat or Hybrid Form Only).</i></b> You have 30 ft. walking speed, 30 ft. climbing speed and 60 ft. flying speed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Immunities.</i></b> You gain immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Shapechanger.</i></b> You can use your action to polymorph into a Medium bat-humanoid hybrid form, a Large giant bat form, or back to your humanoid form. Your statistics, other than your size, are the same in each form. Any equipment you're wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You revert to your humanoid form when you die.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Echolocation (Bat or Hybrid Form Only).</i></b> You gain blindsight out to a range of 60 feet as long as you're not deafened.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Keen Hearing.</i></b> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Nimble Escape (Humanoid Form Only).</i></b> You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sunlight Sensitivity.</i></b> While in sunlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Natural Weapons (Bat or Hybrid Form Only).</i></b> Attack and damage rolls for the werebat's bite are based on whichever is higher of the character's Strength and Dexterity. The bite of a werebat deals 1d6 piercing damage in hybrid or bat form (the character's ability modifier applies to this damage), and the werebat gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. This attack carries the curse of werebat lycanthropy.</p>
