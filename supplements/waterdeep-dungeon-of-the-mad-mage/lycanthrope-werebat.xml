			<p>A werebat is a humanoid afflicted with a rare form of lycanthropy that enables it to transform into a giant bator a bat-humanoid hybrid. (See the Monster Manual formore information on lycanthropy.) Most werebats are of goblin stock.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Deep Dwellers.</i></b> Werebats are shunned even by goblin society because of their need to feed on blood to survive. They prefer to lair in dark places, such as attics and caves, and typically adopt nocturnal hunting habits.</p>
