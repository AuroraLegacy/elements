	<element name="Bottle of Boundless Coffee" type="Magic Item" source="Strixhaven: A Curriculum Of Chaos" id="ID_WOTC_SCOC_MAGIC_ITEM_BOTTLE_OF_BOUNDLESS_COFFEE">
		<description>
			<p>This metal bottle carries delicious, warm coffee. The bottle comes with a stopper, which is attached to the bottle by a little chain. Even when open, the bottle won’t accept any liquid other than the coffee it produces. The coffee inside is always comfortably warm, and none of the heat can be felt through the bottle. </p>
			<p class="indent">Each time you drink the coffee, roll a d20. On a 1, the bottle refuses to dispense coffee for the next hour. If you pour coffee from the bottle, rather than drinking from it, the coffee vanishes the moment it leaves the bottle. </p>

	<element name="Cuddly Strixhaven Mascot" type="Magic Item" source="Strixhaven: A Curriculum Of Chaos" id="ID_WOTC_SCOC_MAGIC_ITEM_CUDDLY_STRIXHAVEN_MASCOT">
		<description>
			<p>Representing one of the mascots of Strixhaven, this soft, Tiny, magic toy is perfect for cuddling. If you press it to your arm, shoulder, or leg as an action, the toy stays attached there for 1 hour or until you use an action to remove it.</p>
			<p class="indent">This toy can also be used to fight off fear. When you make a saving throw to avoid or end the frightened condition on yourself, you can give yourself advantage on the roll if the toy is on your person. You must decide to do so before rolling the d20. If the save succeeds, you can’t use the toy in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
