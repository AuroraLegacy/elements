	<element name="Mimir" type="Magic Item" source="Sigil and the Outlands" id="ID_WOTC_SATO_MAGIC_ITEM_MIMIR">
		<description>
			<p>This skull-shaped device is filled with knowledge. The device weighs 5 pounds and is covered with subtle etchings of planar sigils.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can toss the device into the air, whereupon it floats at a distance of 1d3 feet from you and you can access its properties. While the mimir is floating, a creature other than you can use an action to grasp or net the device, either by making a successful unarmed strike against AC 22 or a successful DC 22 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use a bonus action to seize and stow the device.</p>
			<p class="indent">The device has AC 22, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it is floating near you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Esoteric Knowledge.</i></b> While the device is floating, you can use an action to cast <i>legend lore</i> from the device. The device speaks the revealed lore aloud. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Planar Knowledge.</i></b> The device knows basic, useful information about the planes of existence. While the device is floating, it verbally answers questions you or anyone you designate poses to it about that topic. It knows the information about the planes in the Dungeon Master's Guide, as well as basic information about the gate-towns of the Outlands (presented in chapter 3 of <i>Sigil and the Outlands</i>).</p>

	<element name="Portal Compass" type="Magic Item" source="Sigil and the Outlands" id="ID_WOTC_SATO_MAGIC_ITEM_PORTAL_COMPASS">
		<description>
			<p>This portable arcane instrument points in the direction of the last portal it passed through while it and the portal are on the same plane of existence. If that portal no longer exists, the needle becomes static until the compass passes through a new portal.</p>

	<element name="Sensory Stone" type="Magic Item" source="Sigil and the Outlands" id="ID_WOTC_SATO_MAGIC_ITEM_SENSORY_STONE">
		<description>
			<p>This small, smooth stone contains the essence of a single experience.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you or a willing creature you designate can touch the stone and experience the sensation as if it happened to the designated creature. The illusory experience is fleeting and harmless, however real it might feel in the moment.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Record Sensation.</i></b> You can use your reaction to record a short sensation lasting no longer than 6 seconds experienced by a creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, infusing the essence of that experience into the stone. This replaces any sensation already stored within the stone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Siphon Sensation.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can draw on the stone's magic to end the charmed or frightened condition on yourself, destroying the stone in the process.</p>
