			<p>WELCOME TO THE SWORD COAST—a region of Faerûn that comprises shining paragons of civilization and culture, perilous locales fraught with dread and evil, and encompassing them all, a wilderness that offers every explorer vast opportunity and simultaneously promises great danger.</p>
			<p>While the <i>Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide</i> is a valuable resource for Dungeon Masters, it was crafted with players and their characters foremost in mind. There is a plethora of new character options to intrigue and inspire every member of the adventuring party.</p>
			<p>For use with the fifth edition <i>Player’s Handbook</i>, <i>Monster Manual</i>, and <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i>, the <i>Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide</i> provides the setting, story, and character options needed to participate in a game anywhere along the Sword Coast of the Forgotten Realms.</p>
