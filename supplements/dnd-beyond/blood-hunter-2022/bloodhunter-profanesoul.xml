		<supports>Blood Hunter Order 2022</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Blood hunters belonging to the Order of the Profane Soul have pushed the limits of hemocraft for use against some of the most terrifying creatures corrupting the world. Ancient fiends and cruel magic-users have long counted on their ability to meld into the background and escape those who hunt them, vanishing into noble courts without a trace, or bending the minds of the most stalwart warriors with but a glance. So the blood hunters who founded this order trusted to their resilience as they delved into the same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater threats. And though they might have traded a part of themselves for their power, the members of this order know the benefits of that power far outweigh the price.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also at 3rd level, you augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the warlock spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</em></strong> At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 13th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Your chosen Hemocraft ability (Intelligence or Wisdom) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Hemocraft ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Hemocraft modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Hemocraft modifier</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a conduit for the power of your pact with your chosen patron. While you have an active crimson rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Archfey.</em></strong> When you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, that creature glows with faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature gains no benefit from any cover or from being invisible.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Celestial.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you expend one use of your Blood Maledict feature to heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die + your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Fathomless.</em></strong> You can breathe underwater. Additionally, once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can reduce that creature’s speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Fiend.</em></strong> While using the Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die when you roll the extra damage from the rite, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Genie.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Great Old One.</em></strong> When you score a critical hit against a creature, that creature and any other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of it are frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Hexblade.</em></strong> When you successfully target a creature with a blood curse, the next time you hit that creature with an attack while the curse is in effect, the attack deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Undead.</em></strong> When you take necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage. In addition, your appearance changes to reflect some aspect of your patron while you have any crimson rite active.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Undying.</em></strong> When you reduce a hostile creature of at least mild threat (DM’s discretion) to 0 hit points, you regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.</p>

But you know that your mission is among mortals for now and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.</p>

			<p>You have made a pact with one of the rarest kinds of genie, a noble genie. Such entities rule vast fiefs on the Elemental Planes and have great influence over lesser genies and elemental creatures. Noble genies are varied in their motivations, but most are arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser deities. They delight in turning the table on mortals, who often bind genies into servitude, and readily enter into pacts that expand their reach.</p>

			<p>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell—a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexbade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends. </p>

			<p>You’ve made a pact with a deathless being, a creature that defies the cycle and life and death, forsaking its mortal shell so it might eternally pursue its unfathomable ambitions. For such beings, time and morality are fleeting things, the concerns of those for whom grains of sand still rush through life’s hourglass. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient undead know firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will among the living.</p>
			<p class="indent">Beings of this type include the demilich Acererak, the vampire tyrant Kas the Bloody-Handed, the githyanki lich-queen Vlaakith, the dracolich Dragotha, the undead pharaoh Ankhtepot, and the elusive Darklord, Azalin Rex.</p>
