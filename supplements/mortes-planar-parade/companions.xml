		<supports>Variant Familiar</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Vargouilles are flying Fiends that resemble disembodied Humanoid heads with wings. While most vargouilles roam the planes to curse Humanoids and create more vargouilles, a variant known as the vargouille reflection resides in Undersigil. When a vargouille reflection spots a Humanoid target, it takes on that creature's visage, terrifying that creature by appearing as its own disembodied head.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The vargouille targets one Humanoid within 5 feet of itself that has the incapacitated condition. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target's Charisma decreases by 1 after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects, and its Charisma can't increase. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, the target dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille reflection. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete ends the curse and restores the target's Charisma.</p>

	<element name="Sunfly" type="Companion" source="Morte’s Planar Parade" id="ID_WOTC_MPP_COMPANION_SUNFLY">
		<supports>Variant Familiar</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Sunflies are whimsical, buzzing inhabitants of the Outer Planes. They travel widely and are important indicators of the health of the realms in which they reside; when sunflies struggle, so do the places they inhabit. Sunflies have stingers that they use to inject natural toxins into other creatures. Planar magic can alter a sunfly's toxin so that its effect is different depending on which Outer Plane the sunfly is on.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many inhabitants of the planes have strong feelings about sunflies, viewing them as loathsome pests or adorable pets. Sunflies in Sigil are often the pets of doting, highly protective owners.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The cranium rats squeakers of Sigil have no connection to the mind flayers that created their progenitors. Rather, these magical rodents cooperate with the residents of the City of Doors, whether by simply living together or by pursuing greater ambitions. When squeakers collect in large numbers, their swarms merge into a single intelligence with enhanced psionic abilities and the accumulated memories of its constituents.</p>
