		<description>
			<p>Githzerai migrated to the Everchanging Chaos of Limbo after the ancient schism that split their ancestors from their cousins, githyanki. Limbo is a roiling maelstrom of matter and energy, collapsing and reforming without purpose or direction, until a creature exerts deliberate will to stabilize it. Through their potent psionic power, githzerai carved a home for themselves amid the chaos. As the ages passed, githzerai explorers ranged out to other planes and worlds of the multiverse.</p>
			<p class="indent">Githzerai are generally slender, with speckled skin in shades of yellow, green, or brown. Eons of cultivating their mental powers within the endless chaos of Limbo have imbued githzerai with the ability to shape psionic energy to protect themselves and probe minds.</p>
			<h4>GITHZERAI TRAITS</h4>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Githzerai Psionics.</em></strong> You know the <i>mage hand</i> cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this trait.</p>
			<p class="indent">Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the <i>shield</i> spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the <i>detect thoughts</i> spell with it. Once you cast <i>shield</i> or <i>detect thoughts</i> with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.
