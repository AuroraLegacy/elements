	<!--Feylost Background-->
	<element name="Feylost" type="Background" source="The Wild Beyond The Witchlight" id="ID_WOTC_WBW_BACKGROUND_FEYLOST">
		<description>
			<p>You grew up in the Feywild after disappearing from your home plane as a child. Perhaps you were spirited away by kindly Fey who thought you were destined for great things. Perhaps you stumbled through a fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you gradually fell under the Feywild’s spell and learned a little about the nature of the mercurial tricksters that dwell there.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you finally returned to your home plane, you did not come back unchanged. You are haunted by the fact that the Feywild—a mirror world hidden behind a mere twist of perception—is only a hair’s breadth away. Although your memories of the Feywild grow fainter with each passing day, your heart swells with a mixture of fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to the Plane of Faerie—your home away from home.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of musical instrument</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One choice of Elvish, Gnomish, Goblin, or Sylvan</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A musical instrument (one of your choice), a set of traveler's clothes, three trinkets (each determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table), and a pouch containing 8 gp.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>FEY MARK</h5>
			<p>You were transformed in some small way by your stay in the Feywild and gained a fey mark, determined by rolling on the Fey Mark table.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td class="col-10">d8</td><td>Fey Mark</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>Your eyes swirl with iridescent colors.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>You have a sweet scent, like that of nectar or honey.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>You have long whiskers like those of a cat.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>Your ears are covered with soft tufts of fur.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>Your skin sparkles in moonlight.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Flowers either bloom or wilt (your choice) in your presence.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Your hair is made of vines or brambles and grows back to normal length within 1 hour of being cut.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>You have a tail like that of a dog or another animal.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h5>FEYWILD VISITOR</h5>
			<p>Whenever you're sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit's form by rolling on the Feywild Visitor table. No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minutes or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor can contain any number of things, from messages and insights to nonsense and red herrings, at the DM's discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understand, even if the Feywild visitor can't speak that language normally.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td class="col-10">d8</td><td>Feywild Visitor</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>Awakened creature (a Beast or an ordinary plant that has had the awaken spell cast on it).</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Centaur.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>Dryad.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>Faerie dragon.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>Pixie.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Satyr.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Sprite.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>Unicorn.</td></tr>

	<!--Witchlight Hand Background-->
	<element name="Witchlight Hand" type="Background" source="The Wild Beyond The Witchlight" id="ID_WOTC_WBW_BACKGROUND_WITCHLIGHT_HAND">
		<description>
			<p>You crept into the Witchlight Carnival as a child or youth and never looked back, earning a place among those who work behind the scenes to keep the carnival in business. As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival’s owners—Mister Witch and Mister Light—remain mysterious to you even after all these years.</p>
			<p class="indent">Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or the dream of becoming one of the carnival’s star attractions. Now that you’re older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of the carnival’s journey monotonous. The carnival no longer fills your heart with a sense of wonder. Perhaps greater adventures await you beyond the carnival’s gates.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Performance, Sleight of Hand</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Disguise kit or one type of musical instrument</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A disguise kit or a musical instrument of your choice, a deck of cards, a carnival uniform or costume, one trinket (determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets), and a pouch containing 8 gp.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>CARNIVAL COMPANION</h5>
			<p>Over the years, you have earned the friendship of another carnival fixture. Roll a d8 and consult the Carnival Companion table to determine whom or what you've befriended, or you can choose an option that you like. Work with your DM to flesh out this friendship. This companion hangs around you while you're in the carnival, but it won't voluntarily leave the carnival.</p>
			<p class="indent">The DM can use the Witchlight hand stat block (found in chapter 1 of <i>The Wild Beyond the Witchlight</i>) to represent hands, performers, and animal trainers who serve as carnival companions. Statistics for the other companions appear in the <i>Monster Manual</i>.</p>
			<h5>Carnival Companion</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td class="col-10">d8</td><td>Companion</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>Old, cantankerous Witchlight hand</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Young, impressionable Witchlight hand.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>Performer (such as an acrobat, a clown, or a musician)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>Retired performer</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>Seasoned animal trainer</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Old blink dog</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Cheery sprite</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>Harmless, magical wisp of light (no stat block required) that has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet</td></tr>
