		<description>
			<p>Wereravens are secretive, cautious lycanthropes that seek to blend into society and subtly oppose evil. As avowed foes of malevolent beings, wereravens are stalked by wicked forces. Knowing this, wereravens rarely reveal their hybrid forms. Nevertheless, folktales tell of eerie, raven-winged figures who appear prior to disasters and share mysterious prophecies. Such stories are true, in a way, as where wereravens tread, evil pursues.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wereraven employ light weapons to avoid spreading their curse to those who would abuse it.</p>
