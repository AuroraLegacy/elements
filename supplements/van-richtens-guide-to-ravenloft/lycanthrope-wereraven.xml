		<description>
			<p>Wereravens are secretive, cautious lycanthropes that seek to blend into society and subtly oppose evil. As avowed foes of malevolent beings, wereravens are stalked by wicked forces. Knowing this, wereravens rarely reveal their hybrid forms. Nevertheless, folktales tell of eerie, raven-winged figures who appear prior to disasters and share mysterious prophecies. Such stories are true, in a way, as where wereravens tread, evil pursues.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wereraven employ light weapons to avoid spreading their curse to those who would abuse it.</p>
			<h4>Wereraven Lycanthropy</h4>
			<p>The lycanthropes entry in the <i>Monster Manual</i> has rules for characters afflicted with different forms of lycanthropy. The following text applies to wereraven characters specifically.</p>
			<p class="indent">A character cursed with wereraven lycanthropy gains a Dexterity of 15 if their score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the wereraven's beak are based on whichever is higher of the character's Strength and Dexterity. The peck of a wereraven deals 1 piercing damage in raven form (no ability modifier applies to this damage), or 1d4 piercing damage in hybrid form (the character's ability modifier applies to this damage). This attack carries the curse of wereraven lycanthropy.</p>
