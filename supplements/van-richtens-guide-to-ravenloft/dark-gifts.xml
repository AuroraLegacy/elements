			<p>Your soul isn’t your own or, at least, it wasn’t always yours. Whether you’ve lived past lives, your soul was swapped into a different body, or you have a link connecting you to another being, you experience echoes from another life. These echoes grant you knowledge, talents, or even languages you can’t always explain, but they also intrude on your perceptions and beliefs unexpectedly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on or choose an option from the Soul Echoes table to determine the nature of this Dark Gift. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>

				<tr><td>3</td><td>My consciousness was removed from my original body and implanted in this one.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>I was physically and spiritually merged with another being.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>I share my body with an intangible, otherworldly force.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Time fractures around me, and I sometimes collide with my own past or future.</td></tr>

			<p class="indent"><strong>Intrusive Echoes. </strong>Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your soul’s memories emerge and overtake your perceptions and experiences. You might see people around you as someone other than who they are, or you become disoriented by a double-experience of the world around you. Roll on the Intrusive Echoes table to determine the effect of these vivid memories and perceptions.

			<p>You can cast the <i>alter self</i> spell to appear in your second form. When you do so, you gain the effects of that spell’s Change Appearance option and cannot end it to gain the benefits of a different option. Casting alter self in this way requires no spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift). If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast alter self using this feature, some cosmetic aspect of your second form remains after the spell ends. This visibly marks you unless you actively hide or disguise it. The mark is a perceptible change such as scaly skin, stunted wings, eyes without pupils, or horns. The mark fades after you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>A second being resides within your body along with you. It manifests physically somewhere on you and relies on you for its survival. At the same time, it offers you knowledge and other assistance, either of its own volition or because of your intertwined nature. The symbiote has its own personality and agenda, which might be at odds with yours. If you ignore the symbiote’s desires, it might strive to interfere with you. There is no way to be rid of the symbiote while you have this Dark Gift. Even if you go to drastic lengths, such as severing the part of your body where the symbiote resides, it reappears on your body in another location at the next midnight.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on or choose an option from the Symbiotic Nature table to determine what sort of symbiotic being shares your body. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>

It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The DM sets the symbiote’s abilities or determines them randomly (roll 4d6 for each score, ignoring the lowest roll and totaling the rest). The symbiote can see and hear using your senses.</p>
			<p class="indent">The symbiote speaks, reads, and understands two languages; one that you speak, as well as one appropriate to its nature. Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Perception, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill if you don’t already have it, representing the symbiote’s counsel and guidance.</p>
