		<description>
			<p>Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inherent power—be they legends, histories, or fictions—and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn’t always entirely under their control.</p>

					<tr><td>Bardic Inspiration Die</td><td  class="center">Tale Told Through You</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Tale of the Clever Animal. </strong>For the next 10 minutes, whenever the target makes an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma check, the target can roll an extra die immediately after rolling the d20 and add the extra die’s number to the check. The extra die is the same type as your Bardic Inspiration die.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Tale of the Renowned Duelist. </strong>You make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Tale of the Beloved Friends. </strong>The target and another creature of its choice it can see within 5 feet of it gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Tale of the Runaway. </strong>The target can immediately use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the target teleports, it can choose a number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) to immediately use the same reaction.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Tale of the Avenger. </strong>For 1 minute, any creature that hits the target with a melee attack takes force damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Tale of the Traveler. </strong>The target gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your bard level. While it has these temporary hit points, the target’s walking speed increases by 10 feet and it gains a +1 bonus to its AC.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td><strong>Tale of the Beguiler. </strong>The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die, and the target is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td><strong>Tale of the Phantom. </strong>The target becomes invisible until the end of its next turn or until it hits a creature with an attack. If the target hits a creature with an attack during this invisibility, the creature it hits takes necrotic damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die and is frightened of the target until the end of the frightened creature’s next turn.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9</td><td><strong>Tale of the Brute </strong>Each creature of the target’s choice it can see within 30 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes thunder damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and is knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>10</td><td><strong>Tale of the Dragon. </strong>The target spews fire from the mouth in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to four rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>11</td><td><strong>Tale of the Angel. </strong>The target regains hit points equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier, and you end one condition from the following list affecting the target: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>12</td><td><strong>Tale of the Mind-Bender. </strong>You evoke an incomprehensible fable from an otherworldly being. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take psychic damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and be stunned until the end of its next turn.</td></tr>

			<p>You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell.

			<p class="indent">You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until you roll it again.</p>

			<p>Spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must be of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of divination or necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you perform the ritual, you can’t do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.</p>
