			<p>Wereravens are secretive, cautious lycanthropes that seek to blend into society and subtly oppose evil. As avowed foes of malevolent beings, wereravens are stalked by wicked forces. Knowing this, wereravens rarely reveal their hybrid forms. Nevertheless, folktales tell of eerie, raven-winged figures who appear prior to disasters and share mysterious prophecies. Such stories are true, in a way, as where wereravens tread, evil pursues.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wereraven employ light weapons to avoid spreading their curse to those who would abuse it.</p>
			<h4>WERERAVEN LYCANTHROPY</h4>
			<p>The lycanthropes entry in the <i>Monster Manual</i> has rules for characters afflicted with different forms of lycanthropy. A player character who becomes a werebat gains the following traits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Dexterity.</i></b> A character cursed with wereraven lycanthropy gains a Dexterity of 15 if their score isn't already higher.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Speed (Raven or Hybrid Form Only).</i></b> You have 10 feet walking speed, 50 feet flying speed in raven form; and 30 feet walking speed, 50 feet flying speed in hybrid form.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Mimicry.</i></b> You can mimic simple sounds you heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chattering. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Regeneration.</i></b> You regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn. If you take damage from a silvered weapon or a spell, this trait doesn't function at the start of your next turn. You die only if you start your turn with 0 hit points and don't regenerate.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Natural Weapons (Raven or Hybrid Form Only).</i></b> Attack and damage rolls for the wereraven's beak are based on whichever is higher of the character's Strength and Dexterity. The peck of a wereraven deals 1 piercing damage in raven form (no ability modifier applies to this damage), or 1d4 piercing damage in hybrid form (the character's ability modifier applies to this damage). This attack carries the curse of wereraven lycanthropy.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Change Shape.</i></b> You can use your action to polymorph into a Medium raven-humanoid hybrid form, a Tiny raven form, or back to your humanoid form. Your statistics, other than your size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment you're wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You revert to your humanoid form when you die.</p>
