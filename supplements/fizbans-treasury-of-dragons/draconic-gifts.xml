		<description>
			<p>You become a dragonborn. You replace the racial traits of your original race with the traits of a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragonborn (detailed in <i>Fizban's Treasury of Dragons</i>). The kind of dragonborn you become matches the family of the dragon that is the source of this gift. You can keep any skill proficiencies you gained from your previous race, or you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong> This gift's mechanics aren't implemented in the Aurora Builder. But you can emulate mechanics of this gift by following these steps:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>1.</b> Replace your characters' current race with chromatic, gem, or metallic dragonborn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>2.</b> Select and equip additional skill proficiency items that you can find under Additional Proficiency category of the Equipment section.</p>
