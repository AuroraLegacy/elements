		<description>
			<p>This gold statuette is carved in the likeness of a canary and is small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature in one of two forms (you choose). If there isn’t enough space for the creature where it would appear, the figurine doesn’t become a creature. The two forms are as follows:</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Giant Canary Form.</strong> The figurine becomes a <b>giant canary</b> (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Gold Dragon Form.</strong> While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an <b>adult gold dragon</b> (see its stat block in the <i>Monster Manual</i>) for up to 1 hour. The dragon can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can’t be used this way again until 1 year has passed.</p>
			<p class="indent">In either form, the creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature exists for a duration specific to each form. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the description.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:</p> 
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Breath of Life.</strong> The scale disappears, and you or a creature you touch regains 10d4 hit points.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Platinum Shield.</strong> For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a +1 shield, which you or another creature can use. A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong>Radiant Hammer.</strong> For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic light hammer, which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals 2d4 radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back. If you pull off a scale but don’t speak a command word, it disappears after 1 minute.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This potion looks like liquid gold, with a single scale from a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragon suspended in it. When you drink this potion, you transform into an adult dragon of the same kind as the dragon the scale came from. The transformation lasts for 1 hour. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form or falls to the ground (your choice). For the duration, you use the game statistics of the adult dragon instead of your own, but you retain your languages, personality, and memories. You can’t use a dragon’s Change Shape or its legendary or lair actions.</p>

	<!--Hoard Magic Items-->
	<element name="Hoard Magic Items" type="Rule" source="Fizban's Treasury of Dragons" id="ID_WOTC_FTOD_INFORMATION_HOARD_MAGIC_ITEMS">
		<description>
			<p>Certain magic items can absorb the ambient magic of a dragon’s hoard. The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon’s hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states, which are summarized on the Hoard Item States table. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant state.</p>
			<h5>Hoard Item States</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Sate</td><td>Age</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>Slumbering</td><td>—</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Stirring</td><td>Young</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Wakened</td><td>Adult</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Ascendant</td><td>Ancient</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h4>Increasing Power</h4>
			<p>A hoard item left to steep in a dragon’s hoard absorbs power from the hoard. Older dragons’ hoards are charged with more magic and can empower hoard items to higher states.</p>
			<p class="indent">Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon’s hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard’s dragon, as shown on the Hoard Item States table. For example, a hoard item that steeps in a young dragon’s hoard for 1 year enters its Stirring state, while one that steeps in an ancient dragon’s hoard for 1 year reaches the pinnacle of its power and enters its Ascendant state. If there are one or more hoard items steeping in a dragon’s hoard, the dragon is aware of them. The dragon also knows what these hoard items are and what state (Slumbering, Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant) each of them is in.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon’s hoard for 8 hours rises one state (from Slumbering to Stirring, Stirring to Wakened, or Wakened to Ascendant), as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon’s death and occurs within the dragon’s lair. Steeping in this way can’t raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon’s age—putting a Wakened item in a slain adult dragon’s hoard does not make it Ascendant, for example.</p>
			<h4>Decreasing Power</h4>
			<p>Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon’s hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn’t in a dragon’s hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering.</p>
			<h4>Hoard Item Quirks</h4>
			<p>Hoard items often manifest strange qualities beyond their intended function, regardless of the state they’re in. Roll once on the Draconic Quirks table to determine the quirk of a hoard item.</p>
			<h5>Draconic Quirks</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td class="col-10">d8</td><td>Quirk</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>When resting on the ground, the item points in the direction of the last hoard it steeped in.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>The item’s bearer can speak and understand Draconic.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>The item glows softly when within 60 feet of a Dragon or another hoard item.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>The item’s bearer gains a swimming speed equal to their walking speed.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>The item’s bearer has advantage on Intelligence (History) checks.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>The item’s bearer has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against non-Dragons.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>The item grants its bearer resistance to the damage type of the breath weapon of the last dragon whose hoard the item steeped in.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>The item’s bearer dreams of the dragon whose hoard the item last steeped in.</td></tr>
