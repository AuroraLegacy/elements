			<p>Autognomes are mechanical beings built by rock gnomes in their image, usually with a particular purpose in mind. For example, a gnome might build an autognome to be a steadfast colleague or a loyal companion. Sometimes, because of a malfunction or a unique circumstance, an autognome becomes separated from its creator and strikes out on its own.</p>
			<p class="indent">An autognome bears a resemblance to its creator, and most autognomes are programmed to speak and understand Gnomish. The internal components used in an autognome’s manufacture can vary wildly; one autognome might have an actual beating heart in its chest cavity, while another might be powered by stardust or intricate clockwork gears.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on the Autognome History table or choose an entry to determine what event set your autognome on the path to adventure. If nothing on the table appeals to you, work with your DM to create an origin story for your autognome.</p>
			<p class="indent">Like gnomes, autognomes can live for centuries, up to 500 years.</p>
