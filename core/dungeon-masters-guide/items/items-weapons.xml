		<description>
			<p>This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.</p>

			<p class="indent">In addition, while the sword is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage in combat.

			<p class="indent">You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting banishment on the sword forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The sword then becomes a +1 weapon with no other properties.</p>

			<p class="indent">When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.</p>

		<description>
			<p><em>Whelm</em> is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with <em>Whelm</em>, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Thrown Weapon.</b> Whelm</i> has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Shock Wave.</b></i> You can use an action to strike the ground with <em>Whelm</em> and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Supernatural Awareness.</b></i> While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast <i>detect evil and good</i> or <i>locate object</i> from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Sentience.</b> Whelm</i> is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Personality.</b> Whelm's</i> purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. </p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Whelm</em> has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. </p>
			<p class="indent">The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, <em>Wave</em> happily accepts new converts.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its hit point maximum.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon also functions as a <em>trident of fish command</em> and a <em>weapon of warning</em>. It can confer the benefit of a <em>cap of water breathing</em> while you hold it, and you can use it as a <em>cube of force</em> by choosing the effect, instead of pressing cube sides to select it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Sentience.</b> Wave</i> is a sentient weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. </p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a <i>speak with animals</i> spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Personality.</b></i> When it grows restless, <em>Wave</em> has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods. </p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Wave</em> zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world. The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to—or rebellion against—that god.</p> 
			<p class="indent"><em>Wave</em> harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, <em>Wave</em> fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's demise. This destiny is something <em>Wave</em> might not be able to avert.</p>

	<element name="Moonblade" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_MOONBLADE">
		<description>
			<p>Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a <em>moonblade</em>. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p>
			<p class="indent">A <em>moonblade</em> passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.</p>
			<p class="indent">A <em>moonblade</em> serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.</p>
			<p class="indent">A <em>moonblade</em> won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">A <em>moonblade</em> has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <em>moonblade</em> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.</p>
			<h5>MOONBLADE PROPERTIES</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d100</td><td>Property</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1-40</td><td>Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the <em>moonblade</em> already has a +3 bonus.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>41-80</td><td>The <em>moonblade</em> gains a randomly determined minor property (see "Special Features" in <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> on page 143).</td></tr>
				<tr><td>81-82</td><td>The <em>moonblade</em> gains the finesse property.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>83-84</td><td>The <em>moonblade</em> gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet).</td></tr>
				<tr><td>85-86</td><td>The <em>moonblade</em> functions as a <em>defender</em>.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>87-90</td><td>The <em>moonblade</em> scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>91-92</td><td>When you hit with an attack using the <em>moonblade</em>, the attack deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>93-94</td><td>When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the <em>moonblade</em>, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>95-96</td><td>You can use a bonus action to cause the <em>moonblade</em> to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>97-98</td><td>The <em>moonblade</em> functions as a <em>ring of spell storing</em>.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>99</td><td>You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>100</td><td>The <em>moonblade</em> functions as a <em>vorpal sword</em>.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Sentience.</b></i> A <em>moonblade</em> is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Personality.</b></i> Every <em>moonblade</em> seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a <em>moonblade</em> has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, <em>Blackrazor</em> shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Devour Soul.</b></i> Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by <em>Blackrazor</em> can be restored to life only by a <i>wish</i> spell.</p> 
			<p class="indent">When it devours a soul, <em>Blackrazor</em> grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep <em>Blackrazor</em> in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.</p> 
			<p class="indent">If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, <em>Blackrazor</em> devours your soul.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Soul Hunter.</b></i> While you hold the weapon, you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be charmed or frightened.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Blackrazor</em> can cast the <i>haste</i> spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Sentience.</b> Blackrazor</i> is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, <em>Blackrazor</em> also understands every language you know.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Personality.</b> Blackrazor</i> speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. <em>Blackrazor</em> is meant to hurry that process along.</p>
			<p class="indent">Despite its nihilism, <em>Blackrazor</em> feels a strange kinship to <em>Wave</em> and <em>Whelm</em>, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with <em>Whelm</em> and finds <em>Wave</em> tedious.</p> 
			<p class="indent"><em>Blackrazor's</em> hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.</p>
			<p class="indent">Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the <em>Brutal Pick</em>, the <em>Earthheart Forge</em>, the <em>Anvil of Songs</em>, and the <em>Shaping Hammer</em>. With them, he forged the <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em>.</p>
			<p class="indent">Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</p>
			<p class="indent">Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Magic Weapon.</b></i> The <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em> is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a <em>belt of dwarvenkind</em>, a <em>dwarven thrower</em>, and a <em>sword of sharpness</em>.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Random Properties.</b></i> The axe has the following randomly determined properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Blessings of Moradin.</b></i> If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have immunity to poison damage.</li>
				<li>The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.</li>
				<li>You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Conjure Earth Elemental.</b></i> If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the <i>conjure elemental</i> spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Travel the Depths.</b></i> You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the <i>teleport</i> spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Curse.</b></i> The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a <i>greater restoration</i> or <i>remove curse</i> spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Destroying the Axe.</b></i> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the <em>Earthheart Forge</em>, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.</p>

	<element name="Sword of Kas" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_SWORD_OF_KAS">
		<description>
			<p>When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.</p>
			<p class="indent">For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.</p>
			<p class="indent">The <em>Sword of Kas</em> is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the <i>dominate monster</i> spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Random Properties.</b></i> The <em>Sword of Kas</em> has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
				<li>1 major detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Spirit of Kas.</b></i> While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Spells.</b></i> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: <i>call lightning</i>, <i>divine word</i>, or <i>finger of death</i>. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Sentience.</b></i> The <em>Sword of Kas</em> is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Personality.</b></i> The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.</p> 
			<p class="indent">The <em>Sword of Kas</em> also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the <em>Eye and Hand of Vecna</em>. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Destroying the Sword.</b></i> A creature attuned to both the <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the <em>Sword of Kas</em>. The creature must cast the <i>wish</i> spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the <i>wish</i> spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.</p>

	<element name="Arrow of Slaying" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_ARROW_OF_SLAYING">
		<description>
			<p>An <em>arrow of slaying</em> is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both <em>arrows of dragon slaying</em> and <em>arrows of blue dragon slaying</em>. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an <em>arrow of slaying</em> takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once an <em>arrow of slaying</em> deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.</p>
			<p class="indent">Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as <em>bolts of slaying</em> meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.</p>
