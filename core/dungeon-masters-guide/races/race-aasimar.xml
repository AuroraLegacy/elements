			<p>Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrous hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawing undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2 and Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar are often good. However, some aasimar fall into evil, rejecting their heritage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Aasimar are built like well-proportioned humans. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Thanks to your celestial heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Celestial Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Celestial Legacy.</em></strong> You know the <i>light</i> cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <i>lesser restoration</i> spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the <i>daylight</i> spell once with this trait as a 3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial.</p>
