# Contributing

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for content [issues](#issues) and [requests](#requests). Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support regarding the character builder (use info@aurorabuilder.com or [Aurora Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MmWvNFV)).

## Content Issues

Create an [issue](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy/elements/issues/new/choose) using the _Content Issue_ template.<br>
A content issue might be one of the following:

* missing content from an existing source <sup>1</sup>
* typo in a (sheet) description or and outdated description (due to errata for example)
* incorrect values, traits, or features being added

<sup>1</sup> The source might be marked as incomplete or has an additional information indicator with more information about why it's incomplete. This might be a contribution that was included in an incomplete state in the past. This will not be done in the future to avoid having multiple incomplete sources that are never finished.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests are a great help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Make sure to **not** create one from your master branch, instead create a new branch for it.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. adding significant content, refactoring files), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developer might not want to merge into the repository.

Next, make sure the content contribution falls in the [project scope](#scope) and adheres to the following guidelines to make checking and testing contributes easier and less time consuming.

* Give your commits a meaningful name instead of just _updated file1.xml_
* When making changes to an existing file, increment the version (e.g. from 0.1.2 to 0.1.3)
* Indent (tabs) the files properly to make them readable
* Make sure the IDs of new elements only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`[A-Z]`, `[0-9]`, `_`) and no spaces or other special characters.
* Make sure to check and test your files - for example: when making a class make sure you've tested it with all archetype combinations for levels 1-20
* Ensure the contribution is complete and ready to be checked and merged. If you're working on something large, you can create an issue with a todo list to communicate your progress.
